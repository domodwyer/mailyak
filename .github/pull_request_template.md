<!-- 

Thanks for opening a PR! Seriously, it's awesome, thank you!

To make sure this is as easy as possible, please make sure:

	* There are no breaking changes
	* Your change has tests
	* Existing tests pass
	* You've run the static analysis lints!

The lints run as part of the CI process so they need to pass before the PR can
be merged. If you want to run them locally too see below.

Please delete this template and write your PR message :)

Thanks again!




---

If you want to run the lints locally, they are executed as pre-commit hooks and
are managed with https://pre-commit.com

Once pre-commit is installed, add the hooks to this repo:

```bash
dom:mailyak%  pre-commit install -t pre-commit
dom:mailyak%  pre-commit install -t pre-push
dom:mailyak%  pre-commit install -t post-checkout
```

They will then check any commits you make from now on :)

If you want to quickly run them without committing something, just run
`pre-commit run --all`
